# Food-web-resilience-model
Food web model of alternative stable states in Karatayev, Baskett, and van Nes manuscript: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.27.401711v2

In The American Naturalist entitled "The potential for alternative stable states in food webs depends on feedback mechanism and trait diversity"

This code intended for reproducibility only; for model and analysis details see original manuscript.
The script is laid out in 4 sections: (1) Core dynamical models, 
(2) Functions to generate food webs and evaluate them for feasibility, 
(3) Functions to simulate food web collapse and recovery, 
(4) Functions to analyze & plot food web collapse and recovery, and 
(5) Functions and commands to implement analyses. 

More details are provided in code comments.
